# hnwebxt
a firefox extension for HN

## What it does
It doesn't change anything with regards to appearance,
except for s/Hackers News/HN/.
It adds some features that makes it a wee bit easier
to read subthreads.

## Running
I don't know if I should bother submitting this on https://addons.mozilla.org,
but to run this locally:

1. clone or download this repository
2. open "about:debugging" then click "Load Temporary Add-On"
3. select the cloned or downloaded repository
4. tadah
